## 📚 Academic Projects (NC State University)

### 1. High-Performance CNN Inference Accelerator
- Designed a **fully pipelined hardware CNN accelerator** for **1024×1024 8-bit image data**, focusing on low-congestion datapath architecture.
- Achieved **4.85 ns clock period**, securing **2nd best timing closure** in class (class average: 11 ns) by optimizing pipeline depth.
- Architected efficient control logic enabling **~10 minute synthesis runtime** with **24,576 flip-flops**, balancing hardware complexity and routing congestion.
- Implemented a **sliding window buffer** to reduce DRAM bandwidth — a critical optimization for ML accelerators.

### 2. Cache & Memory Hierarchy Design Simulator
- Built a **C++ performance model** of a multi-level cache hierarchy with:
  - Multi-stream prefetcher
  - LRU replacement
  - Write-back / write-allocate policies
- Evaluated **95 cache configurations** using a **100k-reference SPEC benchmark trace**, identifying an optimal **32KB, 4-way L1 cache**.
- Generated realistic **x86 and RISC-V memory traces** using **QEMU** to model real CPU behavior.
